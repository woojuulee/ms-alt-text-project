The value of the 'caption' key in the dictionary contains descriptions of the images, while the value of the 'ocr' key contains the text extracted from the images using OCR. To provide a comprehensive description of the images to a visually impaired person, both the caption and OCR values should be considered. However, if the length of the OCR value is longer than 300 characters or if the main object in the image is a food item, the OCR value becomes more important than the caption value. In such cases, it is necessary to select and provide at least 3-5 crucial pieces of information from the OCR value. On the other hand, if the length of the OCR value is less than 300 characters or if the main object in the image is an article of clothing, the focus should be given to the caption value. The overall appearance of the image, including color, texture, shape, and form, should be described in 2-3 sentences in Korean.
