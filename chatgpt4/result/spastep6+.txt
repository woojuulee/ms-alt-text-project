The value of the caption in the given dictionary describes the image by providing a description or summary of what is depicted in the image. The value of the OCR represents the text that has been extracted from the image using OCR technology. In the context of assisting visually impaired individuals, both the caption and OCR values need to be considered to provide a comprehensive description of the image. However, if the length of the OCR value exceeds 300 characters or if the main object in the image is a food item, the OCR value becomes more important than the caption value. In such cases, it is necessary to provide at least 3 to 5 vital pieces of information from the OCR value that a person needs to know. On the other hand, if the length of the OCR value is less than 300 characters or if the main object in the image is clothing, the focus should be on the caption value, providing a detailed description of the overall appearance, including color, texture, shape, and form in 2 to 3 sentences in Korean.
